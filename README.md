## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently immersing myself in the world of web development through **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** â€” a fantastic journey filled with code, creativity, and constant growth.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building and refining my frontend development skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, React, NODEJS, and more while tackling The Odin Project.


- âš¡ Fun fact: I love capturing moments and editing them on Final Cut Pro. I'm also teaching myself **Blender** to create 3D art, with the exciting goal of incorporating it into my frontend designs in the future.
